### Java Assignment- 1

## 1. Loops:

a. Write a Java program to print the Fibonacci series up to n terms using a for loop.

b. Implement a program to find the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

c. Create a Java program that uses a do-while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they enter 'q' to quit.

## 2. If-Else Statements:

a. Write a Java program that takes a user's age as input and determines whether they are eligible to vote or not.

b. Implement a program that checks if a given number is even or odd and prints an appropriate message.

c. Develop a Java program to determine the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements.

## 3. Switch Case:

a. Create a Java program that takes a numerical month input (1-12) and outputs the corresponding month name using a switch case.

b. Write a program to simulate a simple calculator using switch case. The user should input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), and the program should perform the corresponding operation.

c. Implement a Java program that takes a day of the week as input and outputs whether it's a weekday or a weekend using a switch case.

## 4. Methods:

a. Design a Java program that defines a method to calculate the area of a circle. The method should take the radius as an argument and return the area.

b. Create a program that uses a method to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.

c. Develop a Java program that defines a method to find the factorial of a given number. The method should be called from the main program.

## 5. Method overloading 

a. Create a Java class with a method named add that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. Now, overload the add method to handle three integers.

b. Implement a class with a method named calculateArea that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle when given the length and width. Overload the calculateArea method to calculate the area of a square when only one side is provided.

c. Define a class with a method named printInfo that prints information about an integer. Overload the method to handle a double and a String, each providing different information.

d. Create a class with a method named findMax that finds and returns the maximum of two integers. Now, overload the findMax method to handle three integers.
