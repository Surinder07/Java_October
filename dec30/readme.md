## Collection 

recap 
List - ArrayList and LinkedList 
internal implementation of list 

1. when my application search intensive -- arraylist 
2. when I have to do more update, insertion - Linkedlist 

Questions : 
given a list of students or employees
find out the employees having the highest salary [using java 8]


## SET

1. it does not allow duplicate elements 
2. it does not maintain any order 
3. it only supports 1 null 

--> HashSet -- no order, no duplicates, 
TreeSet --    no duplicates, elements are stored in ascending order , null not allowed
LinkedHashSet -- order of insertion is maintained, no duplicates, null allowed
